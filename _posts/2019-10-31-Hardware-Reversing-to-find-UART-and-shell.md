title: Hardware Reversing to find UART and shell
---

It's been a long time, but I finally posted a follow up video! In this one we'll dip a toe into hardware reversing by finding a UART (serial port) and using it to get shell access on the device. If you've never done anything with hardware this is a great place to start, or at least get some initial exposure to the concept. 

For those who want to try this on there own I've posted a list of tools/equipment, a set of quick reference steps from the walkthrough, and finally some troubleshooting ideas in case you hit any snags.

### Walkthrough

Did that heading come through?

How about this one

##### Should be a little smaller

How about an image?
